 *  - which stack we are moving to
 *  - which stack is a helper stack
 *
 * This is a challenging question, often used to explain the power of recursion, and as an interview question, so be
 * sure to ask as many questions as necessary, and do not feel desuaded! This is meant to be challenging but fun. :)
